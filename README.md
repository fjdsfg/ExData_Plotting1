#Exploratory Data Analysis - Week 1 Assignment

The following repository presents a list of R scripts that read a dataset from _UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository_, located [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip) with the intention of producing a set of plots required for the first week of Coursera's _Exploratory Data Analysis_.

The scripts require that the dataset is in the same directory, plus the use of _dplyr_ package is mandatory.

Each plot uses R's base plot system.
